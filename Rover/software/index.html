<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>This document describes how to run and compile the software for the
ROMI Rover. If you are a developer looking for details on the source
code then have a look at the separate <a href="/Rover/developer">Developer
Documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a class="headerlink" href="#prerequisites" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The software of the rover runs on Linux. It is not tied to a specific
Linux distribution but we have tested it mostly on recent versions of
Debian (includin Raspian) and Ubuntu.</p>
<p>The software is mostly writen in C and depends on the following
libraries:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/software-dependencies.svg" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>libr</strong>: Common code for the rcom and the libromi libraries. It
  provides some OS abstraction (for example for threads, memory
  allocation, file system, networking), some core functionality
  (logging, time), and some base classes (variable-size memory
  buffers, json parser, lists, serial
  connections). <a href="https://github.com/romi/libr">Code</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>rcom</strong>: An inter-process communication framework. It provides
  real-time communication using UDP messages and high-level
  communication based on web protocols (HTTP, Websockets). It also
  includes several utilities to develop and manage rcom applications.
  <a href="https://github.com/romi/rcom">Code</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>libromi</strong>: Base classes for the romi rover: fsdb (database with
  filesystem back-end), image loading and manipulations, …)
  <a href="https://github.com/romi/libromi">Code</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>romi-brush-motor-controller</strong>: The motor
    controller. <a href="https://github.com/romi/romi-brush-motor-controller">Code</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>romi-rover</strong>: All of the apps for the Romi rover. 
  <a href="https://github.com/romi/romi-rover">Code</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the rover uses a USB camera. It is possible to use the
Intel Realsense camera on the Picamera instead. In that case, you will
have to install additional libraries (see XXX).</p>
<h2 id="installing-a-raspberry-pi-from-scratch">Installing a Raspberry Pi from scratch<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-a-raspberry-pi-from-scratch" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>We use the <em>Lite</em> version of Raspbian. You can download it at
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/</a>. There
are several ways to prepare the disk image for the RPi. Check the page
at
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/</a>
(there’s lots of information available on this topic online) and
follow the instructions that suit you best.</p>
<p>Once you have the SD card, connect RPi to screen, keyboard and network
(ethernet), power up the board and log in (user <em>pi</em>, password
<em>raspberry</em>). The first thing you want to do is change some of the
default settings using the raspi-config tool. In the console type:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo raspi-config
</code></pre></div>
<p>The list of settings that you may want to look at includes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>1 Change User Password
2 Network Options
   Hostname
   WiFi
4 Localisation Options
   Change locales
   Change keyboard layout
5 Interfacing Options
   Enable SSH
8 Update
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, create the user ‘romi’: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo adduser romi
$ sudo adduser romi dialout
$ sudo adduser romi video
$ sudo adduser romi sudo
</code></pre></div>
<p>After that, quit the current session and login again as user ‘romi’.</p>
<p>The <em>nano</em> text editor is installed by default but if you prefer
anoher editor, now is a good time to install it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo apt install emacs-nox <span class="o">(</span>... or any editor you like :<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="installing-the-romi-rover-apps">Installing the romi-rover apps<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-the-romi-rover-apps" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>You should first install the <a href="https://github.com/romi/libr">libr</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/romi/rcom">rcom</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/romi/libromi">libromi</a> libraries. Check out their
the Github pages for the installation instruction and the API
documentation.</p>
<p>You should also flash the motor controller to the Arduino
(instructions are available on
<a href="https://github.com/romi/romi-brush-motor-controller">Github</a>) too.</p>
<p>Once that is done, the installation of the romi-rover apps is
straight-forward. First, check out the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git clone https://github.com/romi/romi-rover.git 
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then proceed to the compilation and installation:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> romi-rover
$ mkdir build
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre></div></p>
<h2 id="compiling-the-picamera-app">Compiling the picamera app<a class="headerlink" href="#compiling-the-picamera-app" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Although not currently used by the ROMI Rover, we have an Rcom app to
access the Picamera. To get it working, you will first have to install
the <em>raspicam</em> library:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git clone https://github.com/cedricve/raspicam.git
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> raspicam/
$ mkdir build
$ <span class="nb">cd</span> build/
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once raspicam is installed, you must re-run cmake to enable the
compilation of the picamera app:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> romi-rover/build/
$ rm CMakeCache.txt
$ cmake .. -DWITH_PICAMERA<span class="o">=</span>ON
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="compiling-the-realsense-app">Compiling the realsense app<a class="headerlink" href="#compiling-the-realsense-app" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The fonctionality of the Realsense camera app is not complete. You can
use it to obtain RGB images and depth images (as BW PNG images). You
will first have to install
<a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/"><em>librealsense2</em></a>.</p>
<p>When librealsense is installed, re-run cmake to enable the compilation
of the realsense app:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> romi-rover/build/
$ rm CMakeCache.txt
$ cmake .. -DWITH_REALSENSE<span class="o">=</span>ON
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the directory /home/romi, create the following directories and copy
the default configuration and script files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> /home/romi
$ mkdir sessions
$ mkdir config
$ cp &lt;romi-rover&gt;/config/config-romi-rover.json config/
$ mkdir scripts
$ cp &lt;romi-rover&gt;/script/config-default.json scripts/
</code></pre></div>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>    &quot;html&quot;: &quot;&lt;romi-rover&gt;/interface/html&quot;,
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="starting-the-apps-on-boot">Starting the apps on boot<a class="headerlink" href="#starting-the-apps-on-boot" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Currently we are still using the old rc.local mechanism. The file
/etc/rc.local is no longer included in more recent Ubuntu versions. If
<code>ls /etc/rc.local</code> returns an error, you will have to create the file
as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo nano /etc/rc.local
</code></pre></div>
<p>Copy the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will &quot;exit 0&quot; on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

exit 0
</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, make the script executable.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo chmod +x /etc/rc.local
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>To enable the apps on start-up, add the following line in
/etc/rc.local, above the <code>exit 0</code> line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>/usr/local/bin/rclaunch /home/romi/config/config-romi-rover.json <span class="p">&amp;</span>
