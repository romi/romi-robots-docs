                  <h1>Configuration</h1>
                
                <p>The rover uses the following input files and directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration file: The main configuration file. This file should be passed on the command line to <code>rclaunch</code>.</li>
<li>HTML directory: The location of the files for the web interface. The path should be set in the configuration file in the <code>webproxy</code> section.  </li>
<li>Script file: The list of operations and associated command sequences. The path should be set in the configuration file in the <code>script_engine</code> section.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration and script files are discussed in detail below.</p>
<h2 id="configuration-file">Configuration file<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-file" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The rover control software is starting using the <code>rclaunch</code>
command. This command takes the path to the main configuration as an
argument. Example configutation files can be found in the
<code>romi-rover/config</code> directory.</p>
<h3 id="the-launch-section">The launch section<a class="headerlink" href="#the-launch-section" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The <code>launch</code> section is required in all configuration files. A
stripped-down version of this section looks like below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>    

    <span class="nt">&quot;launch&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;general&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

            <span class="nt">&quot;user&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;romi&quot;</span>

        <span class="nt">&quot;nodes&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[{</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;path&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rclogger&quot;</span>

        <span class="p">},</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="err">//...</span>
        <span class="p">}]</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>launch</code> section has two subsections, <code>general</code> and <code>nodes</code>. The
first section groups the following settings:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>sessions-dir</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>Where to store the session data (log files, database, dumps)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>The username under which the nodes will be executed</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>nodes</code> section is an array that lists all the nodes that should
be launched. The nodes are launched in the order given, but no
guarantee is given that a node in the front of the list will be ready
for communication before a node later in the list.</p>
<p>Each node object accepts the following fields:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>path</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>The path (or name) of the executable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>args</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>Additional command-line arguments to be passed to the executable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>disabled</td>
<td>Boolean</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>Whether to skip the node or not</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>host</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>To start the node on a remote machine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>The user account to start the node on a remote machine</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The PATH environment variable is used to find the executable.</p>
<h3 id="the-node-settings">The node settings<a class="headerlink" href="#the-node-settings" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Each node can have its own section in the configuration file. The name
of the section must be the name of the node. For example, the
<code>webproxy</code> node will look for the key <code>webproxy</code> at the root of the
configuration file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>    
    <span class="nt">&quot;proxy&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;html&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;romi-rover/html&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>

    <span class="nt">&quot;launch&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="err">//...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="script-file">Script file<a class="headerlink" href="#script-file" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The script file consists of a JSON array of script objects:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;script1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;display_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The First Script&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;script&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="err">//...</span>
        <span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="err">//...</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The script objects have the following fields:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Value</th>
<th>Required</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>The internal name of the script</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>display-name</td>
<td>String</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>The name to be shown to end-users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>script</td>
<td>Array</td>
<td>Required</td>
<td>The list of actions to be taken</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The script itself is an array that lists all the actions to be taken,
one after the other. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;script1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;display_name&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;The First Script&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;script&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
