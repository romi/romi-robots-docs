<div class="todo">
<b>NOTE</b>: This is the new power circuit that will be used with the control panel. It's currently not implemented in either rover.
</div>

<p>There are three separate power circuits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Always-on circuit</strong>: This circuits powers the control panel.</li>
<li><strong>Logic circuit</strong>: This circuits powers the embedded PC and other control circuits.</li>
<li><strong>Power circuit</strong>: This circuit drives all the motors. This is the circuit that is cut when the security switch (the big red button) is pressed.  </li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="" src="/assets/images/power-circuit.svg" /></p>
<p>The control panel actuates two relays (Relay 1 &amp; 2) according to the
two start-up phases (the PC and the logic circuits start up first,
then the motors are powered up). The third relay is designed to handle
strong currents. It has a protection against sparks and
back-currents.</p>
<p>Most of the logic runs on 5V. (TODO: Add a Meanwell power converter. Q: One converter for the the control panel + one of the logic circuit? Or one single converter?)</p>
<p>The figure does not show the power line for the weeding hoe. The hoe
is turned on/off using a fourth relay that is connected to the gShield
board of the CNC. It using the CNC's spindle on/off functionality. You
can find more information on this in the section on the CNC below.</p>

<h3 id="the-navigation-module">The navigation module<a class="headerlink" href="#the-navigation-module" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>The navigation uses a differential wheel drive, with two motorized
wheels in the back and two swivel caster in the front. This makes the
control fairly straight-forward and the components are easy to source.
The navigation module can also receive input from a remote control to
steer the rover.</p>

<p>A CNC is adapted for use in the rover. We replaced the spindle that is
normally used to carve wooden pieces, with a rotating weeding hoe. We
are using to larger, 1000 mm sized version of the
<a href="https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/choose">X-Carve</a>.</p>
<p>The newer X-Carve uses a custom design board for the control. However,
we prefer using the older solution that combines an Arduino Uno with a
gShield because it is smaller and more generic. For the time being, we
use the <a href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki"><em>grbl</em></a> language to send
commands from the embedded PC to the CNC controller. Therefore, any
solution that accepts grbl commands should be drop-in solution for the
Uno+gShield combo.</p>
