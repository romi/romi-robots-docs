# Robotics for micro-farms

ROMI is a four-year Europe-funded research project committed to promote a sustainable, local, and human-scale agriculture.
The goal is to develop an open-source, affordable, multipurpose platform adapted to support organic and poly-culture market-garden farms.

For more information on the ROMI project, please visit the main website at [https://romi-project.eu/](https://romi-project.eu/).

This website is dedicated to the documentation of the three devices
and accompanying software developed by the ROMI project:
