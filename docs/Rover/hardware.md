## The electronics   

### The basic architecture of the control modules   

![](/assets/images/schema-hardware-modules.svg)

<div class="todo">
<b>NOTE</b>: The current rovers don't implements the schema above, yet:
<ul>
<li>The CNC has no encoders.</li>
<li>The rover in Valldaur doesn't have a control panel.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### The control panel

<div class="todo">
<b>NOTE</b>: The control panel is still being developed at the time of writing.
</div>

The control panel is used to start and stop the rover and to display
status information on the character display.

### The power circuit


<div class="todo">
<b>NOTE</b>: This is the new power circuit that will be used with the control panel. It's currently not implemented in either rover.
</div>

There are three separate power circuits:

1. **Always-on circuit**: This circuits powers the control panel.
2. **Logic circuit**: This circuits powers the embedded PC and other control circuits.
3. **Power circuit**: This circuit drives all the motors. This is the circuit that is cut when the security switch (the big red button) is pressed.  

![](/assets/images/power-circuit.svg)

The control panel actuates two relays (Relay 1 & 2) according to the
two start-up phases (the PC and the logic circuits start up first,
then the motors are powered up). The third relay is designed to handle
strong currents. It has a protection against sparks and
back-currents.

Most of the logic runs on 5V. (TODO: Add a Meanwell power converter. Q: One converter for the the control panel + one of the logic circuit? Or one single converter?)

The figure does not show the power line for the weeding hoe. The hoe
is turned on/off using a fourth relay that is connected to the gShield
board of the CNC. It using the CNC's spindle on/off functionality. You
can find more information on this in the section on the CNC below.

### The navigation module   

The navigation uses a differential wheel drive, with two motorized
wheels in the back and two swivel caster in the front. This makes the
control fairly straight-forward and the components are easy to source.
The navigation module can also receive input from a remote control to
steer the rover.

The main components are shown below:

#### Wiring diagram

### The tool positioning

A CNC is adapted for use in the rover. We replaced the spindle that is
normally used to carve wooden pieces, with a rotating weeding hoe. We
are using to larger, 1000 mm sized version of the
[X-Carve](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/choose).

The newer X-Carve uses a custom design board for the control. However,
we prefer using the older solution that combines an Arduino Uno with a
gShield because it is smaller and more generic. For the time being, we
use the [_grbl_](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki) language to send
commands from the embedded PC to the CNC controller. Therefore, any
solution that accepts grbl commands should be drop-in solution for the
Uno+gShield combo.

| Component | Specifications | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| CNC       | Minimum work area: 0.7 m x 0.7m | [X-Carve](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/choose) |
| Optional: Controller board | Must run grbl interpreter | [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno) ![](/assets/images/ext/a000066_front_1_1_1.jpg) |
| Optional: Stepper drivers (3 steppers) | The driver must use the STEP/DIR control signals | [gShield](https://synthetos.myshopify.com/products/gshield-v5) ![](/assets/images/ext/10699531753_e00472237e_b_1_1024x1024.jpg) <br> [Arduino CNC Shield] [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/str/protoneer) and [RepRap](https://www.reprap.me/arduino-cnc-shield.html) ![](/assets/images/ext/sku165456-2.jpg) |

You can still have a look at XCarve's older documentation on how to wire the controller boards:

- http://x-carve-instructions.inventables.com/xcarve2015/step14/ 

Notable, the following two diagrams are of interest:

The yellow wire marked "spinle" in the image above is used to turn the
weeding hoe on or off, as shown in the figure below (see also the
figure in the section on the power circuit).
