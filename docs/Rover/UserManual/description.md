# Short Description

The ROMI Rover is a farming tool that assists vegetable farmers in maintaining the vegetable beds free from weeds. It does this by regularly hoeing the surface of the soil and thus preventing small weeds from taking roots. It can do this task mostly autonomously and requires only minor changes to the organization of the farm. It is designed for vegetable beds between 70 cm and 120 cm wide (not including the passage ways) and currently handles two types of crops, lettuce and carrots. The lettuce can be planted out in any layout, most likely in a quincunx pattern. In this configuration the rover uses a precision rotary hoe to clean the soil both between the rows and the plants. For the carrots, the rover uses classical mechanical tools, such as stirrup hoe, to regularly clean the soil in between the rows. In this configuration, the carrots should be sown in line. 

A weekly passage of the robot should be sufficient to keep the population of weeds under control.
In addition to the weeding, the rover provides the following useful functions. It can draw quincunx patterns or straight lines in empty vegetable beds to speed up seeding and planting out. The embedded camera can be used to collect images of the vegetable beds. It can also be used as a motorized  tray.

The ROMI Rover is targeted at farms that grow lettuce and carrots on a relatively small surface, between 200 mÂ² and 5 ha (Utilized Agricultural Area).
