Segmentation of images 
===

The segmentation of an image consists in assigning a label to each of its pixels. For the 3d reconstruction of a plant, we need at least the segmentation of the images into 2 classes: *plant* and *backround*. For a reconstruction with semantic labeling of the point cloud, we will need a semantic segmentation of the images giving one label for each organ type (e.g. {*leaf*, *stem*,*pedicel*, *flower*, *fruit*}). Figures shows describe the binary and multi-class segmentations for a virtual plant.

## Binary segmentation

The binary segmentation of an image into *plant* and *background* is performed with the following command:

```bash
romi_run_task Masks scan_id --config myconfig.toml 
``` 
with upstream task being *ImagesFilesetExists* when processing the raw RGB images or *Undistorded* when processing images corrected using the intrinsic parameters of the camera. The task takes this set of images as an input and produce either binary mask or real valued maps depending on parameters. 

There are 3 methods available to compute indices for binary segmentation: Excess Green Index, Linear SVM or Vesselness. For each method, we provide an example configuration file in the *Index computation* section.

### Index computation


#### Linear support vector machine (SVM)

A linear combination of R, G and B is used to compute the index for pixel $(i,j)$:

$$
S_{ij}=w_0 R_{ij} + w_1 G_{ij} +w_2 B_{ij} 
$$

where $w$ is the *parameter* vector specified in the configuration file. A simple vector, like $w=(0,1,0)$ may be used. 

Alternatively you can train an SVM to learn those weights and the threshold to be provided in the configuration file. For this, we consider you have a sample image and a ground truth binary mask. A ground may be produced using a manual annotation tool like [LabelMe](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme). 

Using for example a list of 1000 randomly selected pixels as $X_{train}$ and their corresponding labels as $Y_{train}$, a linear SVM is trained using
```python
from sklearn import svm

X_train, Y_train = ...
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
the weights can then be retrieved as *clf.coef_* and the threshold as *-clf.intercept_*


##### Configuration file

```toml
[Masks]
upstream_task = "ImagesFilesetExists" # other option "Undistorted"
type = "linear"
parameters = "[0,1,0]"
dilation = 0
binarize = true
threshold = 0.5
query = "{\"channel\":\"rgb\"}" #This is optional, useful when the *ImageFileset* contains multiple channels (typically when it is produced from a virtual scan)
```


#### Excess green

This segmentation method is assuming the plant is green and the background is not. It has no parameter but it may be less robust than the linear SVM.

We compute the normalized RGB values $x \in {r,g,b}$ for each pixel $(i,j)$:

$$
x_{ij} = \frac{X_{ij}}{R_{ij}+G_{ij}+B_{ij}} 
$$

where $X \in {R, G, B}$ is the red, green or blue image

Then, the green excess index is computed as:

$$
\operatorname{ExG}=2g-r-b
$$


##### Configuration file

```toml
[Masks]
upstream_task = "ImagesFilesetExists" # other option "Undistorted"
type = "excess_green"
dilation = 0
binarize = true
threshold = 0.2
query = "{\"channel\":\"rgb\"}" #This is optional, useful when the *ImageFileset* contains multiple channels (typically when it is produced from a virtual scan)
```


#### Vesselness

!!! danger
	BROKEN the task calls the function vesselness with a *channel* argument which is not in the definition of the vesselness function. It should be repaired or removed

The two previous methods wre based only on color. Instead, here, we consider differential information by relying on the Hessian matrix. The vesselness index is computed according to the method described in [mevislab](https://mevislabdownloads.mevis.de/docs/current/FMEstable/ReleaseMeVis/Documentation/Publish/ModuleReference/Vesselness.html). 


### Binarization

If the *binarize* parameter is set to *True*, a binary mask $m$ is produced from the index *I* by applying a threshold $\theta$ on I for each pixel $(i,j)$:

\begin{equation}
  m_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $I_{ij}>\theta$}\\
      0   & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}       
\end{equation}

### Dilation

If the integer *dilation* parameter is non-zero a morphological dilation is apllied to the image using the function [*binary_dilation*](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.morphology.html#skimage.morphology.binary_dilation) from the *skimage.morphology* module. 

The *dilation* parameter sets the number of times *binary_dilation* is iteratively applied. For a faithful reconstruction this parameter should be set to $0$ but in practice you may want to have a coarser point cloud. This is true when your segmentation is not perfect, dilation will fill the holes or when the reconstructed mesh is broken because the p√¥int cloud is too thin.

### Inversion

For an index I, if you want to use $1-I$, set *invert* to *True*.
