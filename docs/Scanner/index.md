# Plant Phenotyping

**Within the ROMI project, some work packages are oriented towards the development of a plant phenotyping platform adapted to single potted plants.
To achieve this goal, the team developed a suite of affordable opens-source tools presented hereafter.**

We aim at making our software architecture modular to make it more flexible and suitable to most of the robotic & research applications from the ROMI project when possible.
