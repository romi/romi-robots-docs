# How to make a good romi tutorial ?
* **Format**: starts with "How", is a question, should be focused to a user-oriented question
*  **content**: try to build a streamline procedure. If the procedure is too complicated (like different case scenarios, if you need to explain *'if you want to ... and/or if you want to...'*), **consider splitting your tutorial** in as many tutorials as needed to obtain a streamline procedure.

Here a suggested sections for our romi tutorials:

## Step-by-step tutorial

### 1. This is step 1
For non-computer experts, please remember to provide detailed information each time a command line is needed:
- explain if a new terminal should be open or not ;
- precise from where the command(s) should be executed ;
- indicate whether a particular isolated environment should be activated (e.g. conda environment) ;
- give precise and detailed command lines needed (make sure that all commands are given)
```bash
cd my repo #precise from where the command should be executed
command 1 #code comments are wellcome !
command 2 # this is for....
```
Provide ideas of the expected results to check that the commands were successfully run. examples:
> a new folder/object is created

> the terminal says "useful information"
