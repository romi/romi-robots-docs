Building the CNC frame
======================
We chose the X-Carve 1000 mm as basis for the CNC gantry, feel free to choose another one but beware to check the aluminium frame still fit!

## BOM

To build the CNC you will need:

* X-Carve 1000mmm (US buy [here](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/choose); EU
  buy [here](https://robosavvy.com/store/inventables-x-carver-1000mm-in-stock.html))

!!! note
    We chose the X-Carve because initially you could customize your order and for example not order the work area (wood plate).
    Apparently it is not possible anymore!

## Instructions

Follow the official build instructions for the X-Carve [here](http://x-carve-instructions.inventables.com/1000mm/).

You should follow these steps:

* Gantry - Side Plates
* Gantry - X-Carriage
* Gantry - Z-Axis
* Assemble Gantry
* Rails
* Belting

!!! note
    Do NOT follow the steps indicating how to:

    * build the work area
    * fix the spindle
    * fix the gantry and rails over the work area (wood plate)

Once you followed the official instructions, attach the CNC to the aluminium frame before continuing with the next section: wiring the CNC electronics!
