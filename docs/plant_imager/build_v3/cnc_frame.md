# Assembly instructions for the X-Carve CNC frame


We chose the X-Carve 1000 mm as basis for the CNC gantry, feel free to choose another one but beware to check the aluminium frame still fit!

## BOM

To build the CNC you will need:

* X-Carve 1000mmm (US buy [here](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/choose); EU
  buy [here](https://robosavvy.com/store/inventables-x-carver-1000mm-in-stock.html))

!!! note
    We chose the X-Carve because initially you could customize your order and for example not order the work area (wood plate).
    Apparently it is not possible anymore!
