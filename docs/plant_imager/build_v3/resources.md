## File formats

- a `dfx` file is a data file saved in a format developed by **Autodesk** and used for CAD (computer-aided design) vector image files, such as AutoCAD documents. DXF files are similar to .DWG files but are more compatible with other programs since they are ASCII (text) based [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/dxf).
- an `stl` file is a 3D model saved in the stereolithography file format developed by 3D Systems. It contains plain text or binary data that describes a set of triangular facets, which comprise a model. STL files are quite common, and they can be opened in many CAD and 3D modeling programs [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/stl).
- a `step` file is a 3D model file formatted in STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data), an ISO standard exchange format. It contains three-dimensional model data saved in a text format recognized by multiple computer-assisted design (CAD) programs [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303).
- an `f3z` file is a Zip-compressed archive used by Autodesk Fusion 360, a 3D CAD industrial and mechanical design tool [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/f3z).
- an `SLDASM` file is a 3D assembly created by **SolidWorks** CAD software. SLDASM files are comprised of SolidWorks part (.SLDPRT) files, which users combine to form assemblies [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/sldasm).
- an `smg` file is a 3D CAD model saved in the **SolidWorks Composer** file format. It contains a 3D assembly, which may include one or more parts or sub-assemblies. SMG files also store document properties, which include information about the coordinate system and textures of the assembly. [fileinfo.com](https://fileinfo.com/extension/smg).
