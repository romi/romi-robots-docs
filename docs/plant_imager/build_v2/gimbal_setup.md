# Assembly instructions for the custom gimbal


## BOM

The bill of material is short:

* Adafruit Feather M0
* Custom made ROMI gimbal controller hat

## Sources

The sources of the custom-made gimbal controller are available [here](https://github.com/romi/bldc_featherwing/tree/master/CAD).

The source code to compile & upload with Arduino IDE to the Feather M0 is [here](https://github.com/romi/bldc_featherwing).

The bracket for the picamera that also hold the M0 & the hat should be 3D printed.
The design is available [here](https://github.com/romi/bldc_featherwing/tree/master/bracket_rx0).
