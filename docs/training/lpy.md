# Create virtual plants with L-Py

To create virtual plants you can use the L-Py library that implement L-systems in Python with an integrated visual development environment to facilitate the creation of plant models.

L-systems are a _mathematical framework_ for modeling growth of plants.
You can [learn](https://lpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/lsystems.html) more about the L-systems on the official documentation.

## Getting started

The official L-Py documentation can be found here: https://lpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Install with conda:

```shell
conda create -n lpy openalea.lpy -c fredboudon -c conda-forge
```

Then, you need to activate the `lpy` environment

```shell
conda activate lpy
```

Finally, you can start L-Py with:

```shell

```
