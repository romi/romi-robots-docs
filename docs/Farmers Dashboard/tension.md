The Farmers Dashboard carrier has a system the allows dinamyc adaptation to different cable tensions, allowing a light motor torque to move even on high tension cables neede to cover long distances and avoiding slips on low tension cables.

Three pieces of machined HDPE in _sandwich_ form are used to allow smooth movement of the central part of the robot maintaining correct alignment.

To allow a bigger range of tensions pre-compresion level of the springs can be adjusted by turning the three screws under the base piece. By turning the front screws the level of friction between the HDPE slides can also be regulated.

	Test for finding the right combination of spring strength and movement range for common cable setups on poly tunnels is still on.
