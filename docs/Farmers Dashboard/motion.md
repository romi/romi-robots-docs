The platform is battery powered  (12V LiPo 2Ah) and uses a brushless servo motor (DFROBOT FIT0441) combined with an optical cable tracker (ADNS-9800) to precisely move using a close loop system. It also contains built-in end stops switches as well as an inertial measurement unit to ensure it can safely operate autonomously.
