Because of the legal restrictions on the use of drones and because of the rapid evolution of the drone market, the ROMI project has decided to direct its effort to a hardware solution that complements the existing tools (commercial drones, the Rover): the Cablebot. The Cablebot is adapted for use in greenhouses and polytunnels. These installations take up more than 10% of microfarms and are ill-suited for the use of drones. This reorientation increases the impact of ROMI since we can handle a wider variety of contexts than planned. The use of drones is still an option. Existing drones can still be used in combination with the Farmerâ€™s Dashboard. 

To maximize the reuse of components, the Cablebot consists of the following modules:

1. A [mobile carrier](bot.md) that can moves along the cable.
2. A [camera module](camera.md) that easily clips on/off the mobile carrier.
3. A fixed battery [charging station](station.md).

For convenience, when we use the term cablebot, we sometimes refer to the mobile carrier mentioned above, and sometimes to the three modules used as a whole. In general, the meaning should be clear from the context.
The design of the camera module is shared between the Cablebot and the Plant Scanner.
