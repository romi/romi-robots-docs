# Raspberry Pi

## Basic software setup

![](/assets/images/farmersDashboard/rpiZ-08.png)

Download [Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) and burn the image to a sdcard of at least 8GB.
To avid connecting the Pi to a monitor you can follow the instructions to setup [WiFi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) and [ssh](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) (scroll down to number 3) for a headless setup.

Once your Pi is connected to the network and your'e logged via ssh as _pi_ user there are some simple tasks to do:

* For security reasons it is recommended that you change the pasword of default user _pi_
~~~sh
pi@raspberry:~ $ passwd
~~~

* Update packages.
~~~sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
~~~

* Create user romi, set password and add it to needed groups.
~~~bash
sudo useradd romi
sudo usermod -a -G sudo,adm,dialout,video,netdev,plugdev,gpio romi
~~~

* Run `raspi-config` command and change:
1. _Network Options_ â†’ _Hostname_ to _cablebot_
2. If you need you can change keyboard, WLAN country and timezone settings inside _Localization Options_.
3. Enable the cammera, SSH server if you haven't yet and I2C interface in _Interfacing Options_.
4. You can also update _raspi-config_ tool via the _Update_ menu.
5. Select _Finish_ and reboot your Pi (`sudo reboot`).

* Install platformio
~~~sh
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py -o get-platformio.py
python3 get-platformio.py
~~~

Edit your bash profile config fiel (usually `.bashrc`) and add the line 
~~~sh
export PATH=$PATH:~/.platformio/penv/bin
~~~

## OverlayFS

To avoid file system corruption on Raspberry Pi's that can have their power interrupted suddenly, having a read-only file system it's a good option.

> In computing, OverlayFS is a union mount filesystem implementation for Linux. It combines multiple different underlying mount points into one, resulting in single directory structure that contains underlying files and sub-directories from all sources. Common applications overlay a read/write partition over a read-only partition, such as with LiveCDs and IoT devices with limited flash memory write cycles. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS)

When using OverlayFS no filesystem change will survive reboot, that means no bash history!

### Raspbian
In raspbian you can run `raspi-config` and under _Advanced Options_ you will find Overlay FS option:

Just enable it and set boot partition to read only (raspi-config will ask you for this) and reboot. You can revert this changes with the same procedure.


### Archlinux
#### Install Raspi-Overlayroot
~~~
git clone https://github.com/nils-werner/raspi-overlayroot
cd raspi-overlayroot
makepkg -si
~~~
Then try rebooting, it should boot as normal.


#### Enable overlayroot hook
Then in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf`

1. add `overlay` to your `MODULES` array
2. add `overlayroot` to your `HOOKS` array

and rebuild the initramfs by running
~~~
mkinitcpio -P
~~~
and reboot. It should boot as normal.


#### Enable overlayroot in commandline
With the initramfs in place, you can now enable overlayroot by adding `overlayroot` to the end of the Kernel commandline, editing `/boot/cmdline.txt`

~~~
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootwait console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 selinux=0 plymouth.enable=0 smsc95xx.turbo_mode=N dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 elevator=noop overlayroot
~~~
and reboot. You should see a warning during login that any changes you make to your filesystem will be non-persistent after this point.


### Set filesystems readonly
You can now also set the entire root filesystem as readonly by changing `rw` to `ro` in the Kernel commandline
~~~
root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 ro rootwait console=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 selinux=0 plymouth.enable=0 smsc95xx.turbo_mode=N dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 elevator=noop overlayroot
~~~
and adding `ro` to `/etc/fstab`
~~~
#
# /etc/fstab: static file system information
#
# <file system>	<dir>	<type>	<options>	<dump>	<pass>
/dev/mmcblk0p1  /boot   vfat    defaults,ro     0       0
~~~

### Editing the root filesystem
You can run `rwrootfs` to remount all file systems as read-write and change into an interactive shell in your SD card file system. After exiting that shell, the fileystems will remain read-write until next reboot.

Alternatively you can undo all changes from Enable overlayroot in commandline and Set filesystems readonly and reboot. This is the recommended way of system upgrades.

## Romi autossh

Locating a Romi device (ej. cablebot) on a network can be a dificult task depending on the network topology. Services like Dataplicity can solve this problem but have some disatvantages as not being free software, cost, vendor lock, etc.

Having a server accesible via a public IP address is enough to make this work. Maintaining a persistent SSH reverse tunnel with autoSSH between the Romi device and the server will allow us to access the device from anywhere without knowing his IP address.

### Client side (Romi device)

#### Generate a rsa key (withouth passphrase)
~~~
ssh-keygen
~~~
#### Copy your key to the server to allow passwordless access.
The user must exist already on the server, we recomend creating a specific user for this task.
~~~
ssh-copy-id user@server
~~~
#### Test a reverse SSH tunnel

Select a specific port for each of the devices to use on the _port-s:localhost:22_ part of the command, so that port number (_port-s_) of the server will be linked to port 22 on the device.
~~~
ssh -R port-s:localhost:22 [-p srv-ssh-port] user@server-with-public-ip
~~~
Now try to log in from another computer with:
~~~
ssh -J user@server -p port-s user@localhost
~~~

If that worked we can now setup the autossh to make the conection on boot and keep it alive.
#### Install autossh
Depending on your linux package manager, ej. `sudo pacman -S autossh` or `sudo apt install autossh`
#### Test autossh reverse tunneling
~~~
autossh -M 0 -f -o "ServerAliveInterval 45" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 2" -N -R port-s:localhost:22 [-p srv-ssh-port] user@server-with-public-ip
~~~

Options:
> **-M** Specifies monitor port. May be overridden by environment variable AUTOSSH_PORT. 0 turns monitoring loop off.
> **-f** Run in background (autossh handles this, and does not pass it to ssh.)
> **-N** Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports.
> **-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport** Specifies that connections to the given TCP port or Unix socket on the remote (server) host are to be forwarded to the local side.

From the autossh manual page: 
> Setting the monitor port to 0 turns the monitoring function off, and autossh will only restart ssh upon ssh's exit. For example, if you are using a recent version of OpenSSH, you may wish to explore using the **ServerAliveInterval** and **ServerAliveCountMax** options to have the SSH client exit if it finds itself no longer connected to the server. In many ways this may be a better solution than the monitoring port.

So we are using _ServerAliveInterval_:
> Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.

and _ServerAliveCountMax_:
> Sets the number of server alive messages (see below) which may be sent without ssh(1) receiving any messages back from the server.  If this threshold is reached while server alive messages are being sent, ssh will disconnect from the server, terminating the session.

that means that after 45 seconds ssh by itself will try to communicate with the server, if it fails will try again in 45 more seconds and after two failures it will terminate the session, in wich case autossh will restart the connection.


#### Starting autossh on boot with systemd

Create a new file `/etc/systemd/system/autossh.service` and add this to it, remember to set your port (_port-s_):

~~~
[Unit]
Description=AutoSSH service for port port-s
After=network.target

[Service]
User=user
Environment="AUTOSSH_GATETIME=0"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/autossh -M 0 -o ControlMaster=no -o "ServerAliveInterval 45" -o "ServerAliveCountMax 2" -N -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -R port-s:localhost:22 [-p srv-ssh-port] user@server-with-public-ip

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
~~~

Now enable and start the service:

~~~
sudo systemctl enable autossh
sudo systemctl start autossh
~~~

From now autossh will be started at boot time and will keep the tunnel alive.

!!!warning
	Only tested on Arch Linux.

### Server side

The simplest way is using the same user in the server and the clients, so if you haven't already created the user, do it.

#### No Password logins (optional)
For extra security you can disable password login, only allowing logins with keys:

~~~
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
~~~
To do it system wide change `PasswordAuthentication yes` to `PasswordAuthentication no`.

Or if you want to restrict password logins only for a specific user (eg. romi) comment the previous line: `#PasswordAuthentication no` and add this content to the file:

~~~
Match User user(romi)
	PasswordAuthentication no
~~~

The inconvenience of this approach is that every time you want to add a new key (give rights to a new device) you will need to change this temporarily to allow password logins. Remember that after changing the `sshd_config` file you need to restart the service with `systemctl restart sshd`. 


#### Restrict client commands

To avoid security risks in case a key on a romi-device has been compromised, we are going to restrict the commands that the client is able to execute to the minimal.

This can be achieved by editing ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, by prefixing the desired key, e.g. as follows:
~~~
command="" ssh-rsa â€¦
~~~

This will allow any login with this specific key only to execute the command specified between the quotes, none in this example.

### Client side (user computer)

#### Generate and copy RSA key

If you haven't generated your ssh key do it with the `ssh-keygen` command and copy this key to the server and the romi device.


#### Setup connection with ssh config file
Add a new entry in your `.ssh/config` with the following content:
~~~
Host tunnel
    Hostname server-with-public-ip
    [port srv-ssh-port]
    user user

Host romi-device                                                      
    Hostname localhost
    port port-s
    user user
    ProxyJump tunnel   
~~~
This will allow you to simply do `ssh romi-device` to log in your device.
