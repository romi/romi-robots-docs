**Size:** 532mm x 240 x 805mm  
**Weight:** 3900gr (Without Access Point)  
**Power** Input - 120-240V AC, Output - 17V DC  

The Charging Station module (CHAM) provides several features to the cablebot system:

* Rest position with minimal power consumption (motor can be disabled).
* Homming zero position with known precise geo position.
* Shelter from enviromental hazzards.
* Automatic charging via pogo pins contact connector.
* Optional WiFi access point.

It allows the Carrier Module to park in a position that offers shelter against weather elements in addition to providing the necessary voltage for battery charging. A mechanical/magnetic clip system was designed to hold the CARM in a fixed rest position, once parked, the motor can be disabled to save power and a pogo pin contact connector enables charging. Alignment guides allow parking even under windy conditions.

On homming the CARM obtains a georeferenced fixed point from which precise position can be calculated for geotagging captured images. The CHAM holds an AC/DC power supply and an optional Wi-Fi access point.

Installation ca be done directly on the cable with a 4 tensioning system that guarantees stability and allows correct alignment. A vertical fixed post or flat surface such as the wall of a building can also be used as holding structures.

The carrier has three _pogo pins_ that, via an interrupt signal, allows it to know when it is on home position and start the charging process.
