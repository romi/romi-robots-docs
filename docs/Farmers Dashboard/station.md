The charging Station mechanically connects with the mobile carrier during the autonomous charging routine and **recharges** the carrier internal battery as well as provides **shelter** when it's not in use. Alternatively, the carrier can be quickly detached and charged indoors.

The carrier has three _pogo pins_ that, via an interrupt signal, allows it to know when it is on home position and start the charging process.
