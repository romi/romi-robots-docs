# Documentation for Cablebot v2

## Cablebot Hardware

The cablebot uses two Raspberry Pis, one for the base station and one
for the camera.

The PI's should be running the the 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS
Lite.

The user "romi" should be configured on both devices. All the software will be installed in the home directory of the romi user, /home/romi. 


## Cablebot Software

The software is part of the romi-rover-build-and-test repository. It
consists of four separate applications that communicate with each
other over websockets:

* rcom-registry: A directory service that keeps track of the addresses of the applications
* romi-config: A shared configuration service for the ROMI services 
* romi-camera: The interface to the camera
* romi-cnc: The interface to any CNC device for the motion 
* romi-cablebot: To program the execution of scans at defined times 


### Base station

The following steps have to be taken on the Raspberry Pi that runs the base station:

* Get the source code
* Compile the apps
* Install the Python library
* Copy the config file
* Start the apps
* Run the tests

#### Get the source code

To clone the romi-rover-build-and-test repo, do:

```sh
$ cd /home/romi
$ git clone --branch ci_dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test.git
```

#### Compile the apps

To compile the apps: rcom-registry, romi-cnc, and romi-config:

```sh
$ cd romi-rover-build-and-test
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make rcom-registry romi-config romi-cnc romi-cablebot
```

#### Install the Python library

```sh
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/librcom/python
$ pip install --editable .
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/python
$ pip install --editable .
```

#### Copy the config file

```sh
$ cp /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/config/cablebot-v2.json /home/romi/config.json 
```

#### Start the apps

Open a terminal and start the RCOM directory service:
```sh
$ /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/rcom-registry 
```

You should see something like:
```sh
Registry server running at 172.20.10.3:10101
```

Open a second terminal and start the config server:
```sh
$ /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-config --config /home/romi/config.json 
```

Open a third terminal and start the CNC:
```sh
$ /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-cnc 
```

You should see a bunch of messages, and also the path of the log file:
```sh
...
Changing log to '/tmp/romi/log.txt'
...
```

Finally, in a fourth terminal and start the Cablebot app:
```sh
$ /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-cablebot 
```

The Cablebot app is optional, actually. You'll find more info below. 


#### Run the tests

In the Python directory, you'll find example code that you can use to test the services.

You can test the config interface, run:
```sh
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/python
$ python3 config.py
```

You can test the CNC interface as follows:
```sh
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/python
$ python3 cnc.py
```


### Camera module

For the camera module, many of the steps are similar as above. In this case, we'll only compile the romi-camera app.

* Get the source code
* Compile the app
* Start the app
* Run the tests

#### Get the source code

To clone the repo, do:

```sh
$ cd /home/romi
$ git clone --branch ci_dev --recurse-submodules https://github.com/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test.git
```

#### Compile romi-camera

To compile romi-camera:

```sh
$ cd romi-rover-build-and-test
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make romi-camera
```

#### Start the app

Open a terminal and run:
```sh
$ /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-camera --config /home/romi/config.json --directory /home/romi
```

You should see a bunch of messages, and also the path of the log file:
```sh
...
Changing log to '/tmp/romi/log.txt'
...
```

You can always check that log file for more info.

In the terminal that runs rcom-registry, you should see (IP and port numbers will differ):

```sh
INFO: RegistryServer: Received message: {"request": "register", "topic": "camera", "address": "172.20.10.3:55229"}
INFO: RegistryServer: Register topic 'camera' at 172.20.10.3:55229
```

#### Run the tests

On the base station, you can test the camera interface through the Python API:
```sh
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/python
$ python3 camera.py
```

It should store 10 images on the disk, named camera-xxxx.jpg.


## Installation on an Intel Linux PC

The software can also be compiled and tested on a regular PC running Linux. 

We'll suppose that the repository will be cloned in the directory HOME_ROMI. Then do the following.

```sh
$ cd $HOME_ROMI
$ cd romi-rover-build-and-test
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make rcom-registry romi-config romi-cnc romi-camera
```

Install the Python library:

```sh
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/librcom/python
$ pip install --editable .
$ cd /home/romi/romi-rover-build-and-test/python
$ pip install --editable .
```

Edit the config file:

If you don't have an USB camera connected to the PC, you can configure
a "fake" camera. In the config file, change the camera type to
"fake-camera". Don't change anything else:

```
{
    "camera": {
        "type": "fake-camera"
    }
}
```

The camera will serve an image with random noise.

If you don't have a CNC connected to the PC, you can configure a fake
CNC in the config file. Change the "controller-classname" parameter to
"fake-cnc-controller". Keep everything else unchanged.

```
{
    "cnc": {
        "controller-classname": "fake-cnc-controller"
    }
}
```


Start the applications:

```sh
$ $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/rcom-registry &
$ $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-config --config $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/config/cablebot-v2-dev.json &
$ $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-cnc &
$ $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-camera &
$ $HOME_ROMI/romi-rover-build-and-test/build/bin/romi-cablebot &
```

## Python script versus Cablebot app

There are two ways to work with the cablebot:

1. Write you're own Python script
2. Use the Cablebot app

### Python script

You can use the Python API for the camera and the cnc to write your
own scanning script. Below is an example that may be helpful.

```python
import argparse
import time
from romi.cnc import CNC
from romi.camera import Camera


def startup_cnc(cnc):
    # Turn off the battery charger
    cnc.set_relay(0, True)
    # Power-up the motor
    cnc.power_up()

    
def scan(cnc, camera, x0, dx, count):
    for i in range(count + 1):
        x = x0 + i * dx
        cnc.moveto(x, 0, 0, 0.75)
        time.sleep(1)
        image = camera.grab()
        if image != None:
            filename = f"cablebot-{i:05d}-{int(1000*x):05d}.jpg"
            print(f"Saving {filename}")
            image.save(filename)

            
def shutdown_cnc(cnc, no_homing):
    if no_homing:
        cnc.moveto(0.0, 0, 0, 0.75)
    else:
        # Return to 4 cm before the homing
        cnc.moveto(0.04, 0, 0, 0.75)
        cnc.homing()
        
    cnc.power_down()
    # Recharge the battery
    cnc.set_relay(0, False)
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--start', type=float, nargs='?', default=0.0,
                    help='The start position')
    parser.add_argument('--interval', type=float, nargs='?', default=0.5,
                    help='The distance between camera positions')
    parser.add_argument('--count', type=int, nargs='?', default="1",
                    help='The number of images')
    parser.add_argument('--no-homing', action=argparse.BooleanOptionalAction,
                        help='Go back to zero without the homing procedure')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    cnc = CNC("cnc", "cnc")
    camera = Camera("camera", "camera")

    startup_cnc(cnc)
    scan(cnc, camera, args.start, args.interval, args.count)
    shutdown_cnc(cnc, args.no_homing)
```
