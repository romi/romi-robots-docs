<p>We recommend the <strong>Raspberry Pi Imager</strong> tool to burn  a new Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite. 
You can find it <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Or you can download an official ZIP <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="a-enable-ssh-remote-access">A - Enable SSH remote access<a class="headerlink" href="#a-enable-ssh-remote-access" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>After installing the Raspberry Pi OS, add an empty file <code>ssh</code> in the <code>boot</code> partition to enable SSH access.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>As we will later use the wifi from the PiZero to create an Access Point, we recommend to use the ethernet port to SSH in the PiZero.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="b-use-local-access">B - Use local access<a class="headerlink" href="#b-use-local-access" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Otherwise use a screen and keyboard to access the PiZero.</p>
<h3 id="raspberry-pi-os-setup">Raspberry Pi OS setup<a class="headerlink" href="#raspberry-pi-os-setup" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Before installing the softwares, you have to configure some of the Raspberry Pi OS settings &amp; change the password.</p>
<h4 id="change-the-password">Change the password<a class="headerlink" href="#change-the-password" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>For security reasons, you have to change the <code>pi</code> user password because the default is known by everyone!</p>
<p>Use the raspi-config` tool to do it:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo raspi-config
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The default password is <code>raspberry</code>!</p>
</div>
<h4 id="edit-the-timezone-locales">Edit the timezone &amp; locales<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-the-timezone-locales" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Change the timezone to get the right time from the PiZero clock!
You may also change the locales to suits your needs.</p>
<h2 id="create-the-wifi-access-point">Create the WiFi Access Point<a class="headerlink" href="#create-the-wifi-access-point" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>We will now create the AP using command lines follwoing the tutorial from: <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-3-as-an-access-point/all">https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/setting-up-a-raspberry-pi-3-as-an-access-point/all</a>.</p>
<p>You may also be interested by doing this with a graphical interface and we would highly recommend <a href="https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui">raspap-webgui</a>.</p>
<h3 id="install-packages">Install Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#install-packages" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>To install the required packages, enter the following into the console:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get -y install hostapd dnsmasq
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="set-static-ip-address">Set Static IP Address<a class="headerlink" href="#set-static-ip-address" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Edit the <code>dhcpcd.conf</code> file:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
</code></pre></div>
At the bottom of the file, add:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>denyinterfaces wlan0
</code></pre></div>
Save and exit by pressing <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><span>+</span><kbd class="key-x">X</kbd></span> and <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-y">Y</kbd></span> when asked.</p>
<p>Next, we need to tell the Raspberry Pi to set a static IP address for the WiFi interface.
Open the interfaces file with the following command:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
</code></pre></div>
At the bottom of that file, add the following:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet static
    address 192.168.0.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    network 192.168.0.0
    broadcast 192.168.0.255
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="configure-hostapd">Configure Hostapd<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-hostapd" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>We need to set up hostapd to tell it to broadcast a particular SSID and allow WiFi connections on a certain channel.
Edit the hostapd.conf file (this will create a new file, as one likely does not exist yet) with this command:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo nano /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf
</code></pre></div>
Enter the following into that file.
Feel fee to change the ssid (WiFi network name) and the wpa_passphrase (password to join the network) to whatever you'd like.
You can also change the channel to something in the 1-11 range (if channel 6 is too crowded in your area).
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=romi_hotspot
hw_mode=g
channel=6
ieee80211n=1
wmm_enabled=1
ht_capab=[HT40][SHORT-GI-20][DSSS_CCK-40]
macaddr_acl=0
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_passphrase=raspberry
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
</code></pre></div>
Save and exit by pressing <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><span>+</span><kbd class="key-x">X</kbd></span> and <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-y">Y</kbd></span> when asked.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>hostapd</code> does not know where to find this configuration file, so we need to provide its location to the hostapd startup script.</p>
<p>Open <code>/etc/default/hostapd</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo nano /etc/default/hostapd
</code></pre></div>
Find the line #DAEMON_CONF="" and replace it with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>DAEMON_CONF=&quot;/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf&quot;
</code></pre></div>
Save and exit by pressing <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-control">Ctrl</kbd><span>+</span><kbd class="key-x">X</kbd></span> and <span class="keys"><kbd class="key-y">Y</kbd></span> when asked.</p>
<h3 id="configure-dnsmasq">Configure Dnsmasq<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-dnsmasq" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Dnsmasq will help us automatically assign IP addresses as new devices connect to our network as well as work as a translation between network names and IP addresses.
The <code>.conf</code> file that comes with Dnsmasq has a lot of good information in it, so it might be worthwhile to save it (as a backup) rather than delete it.
After saving it, open a new one for editing:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo mv /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.conf.bak
sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>In the blank file, paste in the text below.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>interface=wlan0 
listen-address=192.168.0.1
bind-interfaces 
server=8.8.8.8
domain-needed
bogus-priv
dhcp-range=192.168.0.100,192.168.0.200,24h
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="test-wifi-connection">Test WiFi connection<a class="headerlink" href="#test-wifi-connection" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Restart the Raspberry Pi using the following command:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>After your Pi restarts (no need to log in), you should see <code>romi_hotspot</code> appear as a potential wireless network from your computer.</p>
<p>Connect to it (the network password is raspberry, unless you changed it in the <code>hostapd.conf</code> file).
Then try to SSH it with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>ssh pi@192.138.0.1
</code></pre></div></p>
<h2 id="install-python3-pip">Install Python3 &amp; pip<a class="headerlink" href="#install-python3-pip" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>You will need the Python3 interpeter (Python&gt;=3.6) to run the PiCamera server &amp; <code>pip</code> to install the Picamera package.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
</code></pre></div>
This will update the package manager, upgrade the system libraries &amp; install Python3 &amp; pip.</p>
<h2 id="install-picamera-package">Install Picamera package<a class="headerlink" href="#install-picamera-package" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Once you have <code>pip</code> you can install the <code>picamera</code> Python3 package:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip3 install picamera
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We do not create an isolated environment in this case since the sole purpose of the PiZero will be to act as a reponsive image server.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="camera-serve-python-code">Camera serve Python code<a class="headerlink" href="#camera-serve-python-code" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>To capture and serve the images from the PiCamera, we use this Python script:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jlegrand62/c24e454922f0cf203d6f9ed49f95ecc1.js"></script>

<p>To upload it to your PiZero, from a terminal:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>wget https://gist.github.com/jlegrand62/c24e454922f0cf203d6f9ed49f95ecc1/raw/c4cda40ff56984188dca928693852f3f7a317fa4/picamera_server.py
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Now (test) start the server with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>python3 picamera_server.py
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition todo">
<p class="admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p>Explain how to execute <code>python3 picamera_server.py</code> command at PiZero boot.</p>
