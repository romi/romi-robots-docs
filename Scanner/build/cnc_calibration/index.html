<h2 id="using-grbl">Using Grbl<a class="headerlink" href="#using-grbl" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>

<h3 id="connect-to-the-arduino">Connect to the Arduino<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-to-the-arduino" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Then you can use <a href="https://github.com/npat-efault/picocom">picocom</a> to connect to the arduino:

<p>You can type <code>$</code> (and press enter) to get help.
You should not see any local echo of the <code>$</code> and enter. Grbl should respond with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>[HLP:$$ $# $G $I $N $x=val $Nx=line $J=line $SLP $C $X $H ~ ! ? ctrl-x]
ok

<p>By default, Grbl assumes that the axes move in a positive direction when the direction pin signal is low, and a negative direction when the pin is high.</p>

<p>For example, if want to invert the Y axis direction only, you'd send <code>$3=2</code> to Grbl and the setting should now read <code>$3=2 (dir port invert mask:00000010)</code></p>
<h3 id="edit-the-acceleration-rates">Edit the acceleration rates<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-the-acceleration-rates" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Parameters named <code>$120</code>, <code>$121</code> &amp; <code>$123</code> control the axes acceleration in mm/second/second.</p>
<p>From the official wiki:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>Simplistically, a lower value makes Grbl ease slower into motion, while a higher value yields tighter moves and reaches the desired feed rates much quicker.
Much like the max rate setting, each axis has its own acceleration value and are independent of each other.
This means that a multi-axis motion will only accelerate as quickly as the lowest contributing axis can.</p>
</div>
<p>Since the Z-axis arm is long and have a "heavy weight" (gimbal + camera) at its lower end, it is probably a good to keep low values to avoid blurry image due to shaking!</p>
<p>To determine optimal values, the official wiki is clear, you will have to run some tests:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p>Again, like the max rate setting, the simplest way to determine the values for this setting is to individually test each axis with slowly increasing values until the motor stalls.
Then finalize your acceleration setting with a value 10-20% below this absolute max value. This should account for wear, friction, and mass inertia.
We highly recommend that you dry test some G-code programs with your new settings before committing to them. Sometimes the loading on your machine is different when moving in all axes together.</p>
</div>
<p>For example you can send <code>$120=100.0</code> to set the X axis acceleration rate to 100 mm/second².</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Deceleration rates may also create shaking!</p>
