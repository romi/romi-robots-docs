<p>We hereafter details how you can make your own algorithms available to the ROMI reconstruction and analysis pipeline by creating a task and registering it as an available module.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity and to illustrate how-to create a ROMI task from scratch, in this guide we will assume you want to add something quite different from what is already there.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>ROMI task usually have a <strong>semantic meaning</strong> and for example, the task <code>AnglesAndInternodes</code> may takes several type of object in input (mesh, pointcloud &amp; skeletons) but always output the JSON file with the obtained measures.
So, to decide if you have to create a new task or add your algorithm to an existing task, following this rule should help: <strong>at a given step of the pipeline, if the output change, this is a NEW task!</strong></p>
</div>
<h2 id="add-you-algorithm-to-romiscan">Add you algorithm to <code>romiscan</code><a class="headerlink" href="#add-you-algorithm-to-romiscan" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>You first have to add a file (or append to an existing one), <em>e.g.</em> named <code>algo.py</code>, under the <code>romiscan/romiscan</code> directory.</p>
<p>Let's assume the previously added file has a main function called <code>my_algo</code> like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">my_algo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># Do something to data with given parameters to return transformed data `out_data`</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">out_data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">error</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>It has:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>data input(s)</strong> (<em>e.g.</em> images, point clouds, meshes, ...) that will often be the output of a previous task in the pipeline</li>
<li><strong>parameter(s)</strong>, specific to the algorithm you want to add</li>
<li><strong>output(s)</strong>, the transformed dataset that will often be the input of a following task in the pipeline</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-a-romi-task">Create a ROMI task<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-romi-task" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<h3 id="dependency-to-luigi">Dependency to <code>luigi</code><a class="headerlink" href="#dependency-to-luigi" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>We use <code>luigi</code> to manage the pipeline execution and handle requirements &amp; tasks dependencies. 
To create a task you will thus have to create a new Python class <code>MyTask</code> inheriting from the <code>RomiTask</code> class and creates a few methods and at least a <code>run</code> method used by <code>luigi</code>.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-to-romidata">Dependency to <code>romidata</code><a class="headerlink" href="#dependency-to-romidata" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>To manage the files, inputs and outputs, we use the <code>romidata</code> package implementing a local file system database written in pure python.
It provides classes and methods that simplifies and normalize the creation and use of the tasks outputs and inputs.  </p>
<h3 id="new-romitask-template">New <code>RomiTask</code> template<a class="headerlink" href="#new-romitask-template" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>You will create a new python file <code>my_task.py</code> in the 'task' submodule: <code>romiscan/romiscan/tasks/my_task.py</code>
