<h4 id="db">DB<a class="headerlink" href="#db" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Should be totally independent of the rest since it could be uses in other parts of the ROMI project (Rover, Cable bot, ...) trough the abstract class <code>DB</code> or even the local database class <code>FSDB</code>.</p>
<h4 id="plantscanner">PlantScanner<a class="headerlink" href="#plantscanner" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>It requires a physical connection to the hardware (<code>pyserial</code>) to control. It also needs an active ROMI database to export acquired datasets (plant images).</p>
<h4 id="smartinterpreter">SmartInterpreter<a class="headerlink" href="#smartinterpreter" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>It requires connection to an active ROMI database to import datasets to process and export the results.
Two plant reconstruction approaches are available in the SmartInterpreter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Geometry based, try to infer the plant's geometry using structure from motion algorithms and space carving to first reconstruct a point cloud. </li>
<li>Machine learning based, try to infer the plant's geometry using semantic (organ) segmentation of pictures and space carving to first reconstruct a labelled point cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then meshing and skeletonization finally enables to extract the plant's phyllotaxis.</p>
