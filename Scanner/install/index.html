<p>In the following subsections we will details how to install ROMI software for a few usage cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a database server <a href="romidb_setup/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Plant scans acquisition using the ROMI plant scanner to a database <a href="plant_scanner_setup/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Plant reconstruction pipelines from existing plant scans in a database <a href="plant_reconstruction_setup/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Virtual plant creation (3D modelling of plant architecture with LPY), virtual scan (mimic plant scanner with blender) &amp; reconstruction (same as 2.) <a href="virtual_plant_setup/">here</a>.</li>
<li>Create a web server hosting the plant 3d explorer GUI <a href="plant3dexplorer_setup/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>You can find <strong>docker images</strong> for use cases #1, #3 &amp; #5 in the dockerhub repository of the ROMI project <a href="https://hub.docker.com/orgs/roboticsmicrofarms/repositories">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cloning-sources">Cloning sources<a class="headerlink" href="#cloning-sources" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>To clone the git repository, you will need: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>git</code></li>
<li><code>ca-certificates</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Start with these system dependencies:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install git ca-certificates
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="downloading-from-urls">Downloading from URLs<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-from-urls" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes the documentation will provides commands with <code>wget</code> to download archives or other types of files, here is the command line to install it if you do not have it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt install wget
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="creating-isolated-python-environments">Creating isolated Python environments<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-isolated-python-environments" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important</p>
<p>We recommend using <code>conda</code> to create isolated environments as some packages, like <code>openalea.lpy</code>, are available as <code>conda</code> packages but not from <code>pip</code> and can be tricky to install from sources!</p>
</div>
<p>Follow this <a href="create_env/#isolated-environments-with-miniconda">link</a> to learn how to install <code>miniconda3</code> &amp; create isolated Python environments with <code>conda</code>.</p>
<p>If you have no idea why you should use isolated Python environments, here is a quote from the official Python documentation:</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Quote</p>
<p><code>venv</code> (for Python 3) and <code>virtualenv</code> (for Python 2) allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. 
They essentially allow you to create a "virtual" isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation.
When you switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not have to worry about breaking the packages installed in the other environments.
It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="list-of-sources">List of sources<a class="headerlink" href="#list-of-sources" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>For the ROMI projects, several libraries have been developed in various languages and made available on GitHub.
Here is a list of the important repositories for the plant scanner project:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romidata</code>: the database module is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/romidata">here</a>;</li>
<li><code>romiscanner</code>: the scanner interface and the virtual scanner is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/romiscanner">here</a>;</li>
<li><code>romiscan</code>: the computer vision algorithms to reconstruct the plants is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/romiscan">here</a>;</li>
<li><code>romiseg</code>: the ML-based plant segmentation models is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/romiseg">here</a>;</li>
<li><code>3d-plantviewer</code>: the Node JS web viewer for plant scan, reconstruction and quantification is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/3d-plantviewer">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally we also have:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>romicgal</code>: some <a href="https://www.cgal.org/">CGAL</a> bindings used for skeletonization &amp; meshing is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/romicgal">here</a></li>
<li><code>bldc_featherwing</code>: the controller for BLDC motor on a feather wing is accessible <a href="https://github.com/romi/bldc_featherwing">here</a></li>
