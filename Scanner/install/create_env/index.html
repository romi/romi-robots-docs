<p>You can use <code>venv</code> or <code>conda</code> to create isolated Python environments.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Some of the ROMI libraries have dependencies relying on specific Python versions. Make sure that the isolated environment you create match these requirements!</p>
</div>
<h2 id="isolated-environments-with-venv">Isolated environments with <code>venv</code><a class="headerlink" href="#isolated-environments-with-venv" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<h3 id="requirements">Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Python 3 &amp; <code>pip</code> are required.
On Debian-like OS, use the following command to install them:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>For more details &amp; explanations, follow <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#">this</a> official guide to learn how to install packages using pip and virtual environments.</p>
<h3 id="environment-creation">Environment creation<a class="headerlink" href="#environment-creation" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>To create a new environment, named <code>plant_scanner</code>, use <code>python3</code> and the <code>venv</code> module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>python3 -m venv plant_scanner
</code></pre></div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This will create a <code>plant_scanner</code> folder in the current working directory and place the "environment files" there! We thus advise to gather all your environment in a common folder like <code>~/envs</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>To activate it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">source</span> plant_scanner/bin/activate
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="usage">Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Now you can easily install Python packages, for example <code>NumPy</code>, as follow:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip3 install numpy
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Use <code>deactivate</code> or kill terminal to leave it!</p>
</div>
<p>You can now use this environment to install the ROMI software &amp; dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="isolated-environments-with-miniconda">Isolated environments with <code>miniconda</code><a class="headerlink" href="#isolated-environments-with-miniconda" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<h3 id="requirements_1">Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements_1" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>In this case you do not need Python to be installed on your system, all you need it to install <code>miniconda3</code>.
You can download the latest <code>miniconda3</code> version with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>On Debian-like OS, use the following command to install it:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>For more details &amp; explanations, follow <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#">this</a> official guide to learn how to install <code>miniconda</code>.</p>
<h3 id="environment-creation_1">Environment creation<a class="headerlink" href="#environment-creation_1" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>To create a new conda environment, named <code>plant_scanner</code> with Python 3.7:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>conda create --name plant_scanner <span class="nv">python</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="m">3</span>.7
</code></pre></div>
<p>To activate it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>conda activate plant_scanner
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="usage_1">Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage_1" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Now you can now easily install Python packages, for example <code>NumPy</code>, as follow:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>conda install numpy
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Use <code>conda deactivate</code> or kill terminal to leave it!</p>
</div>
<p>You can now use this environment to install the ROMI software &amp; dependencies.</p>
