<p>To follow this guide you should have a <code>conda</code> environment, see <a href="../create_env/">here</a>.
For the sake of clarity it will be called <code>plantscans_db</code>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Since this is still under development, the packages are installed in "editable mode" with the <code>-e</code> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you do not want the hassle of having to create environment &amp; install python libraries, there is a pre-built docker image, with usage instructions <a href="../../docker/romidb_docker/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="install-romidata-sources">Install <code>romidata</code> sources<a class="headerlink" href="#install-romidata-sources" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Activate your <code>plantscans_db</code> environment!
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>conda activate plantscans_db
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>To create an active ROMI database, you have to install the <code>romidata</code> package:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>git clone https://github.com/romi/romidata.git <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span> romidata <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
git checkout dev <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
python3.7 -m pip install setuptools setuptools-scm <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
python3.7 -m pip install luigi pillow <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
python3.7 -m pip install flask flask-restful flask-cors <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
python3.7 -m pip install .
</code></pre></div></p>
<h2 id="initialize-a-romi-database">Initialize a ROMI database<a class="headerlink" href="#initialize-a-romi-database" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The <code>FSDB</code> class from the <code>romidata</code> module is used to manage a local file system for data storage.
A database is any folder which contains a file named <code>romidb</code>.</p>
<p>To create an empty database, just create a new folder and an empty file named <code>romidb</code> in it.
For example:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir /data/romi_db
touch /data/romi_db/romidb
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Then define its location in an environment variable <code>DB_LOCATION</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">DB_LOCATION</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;/data/ROMI/DB&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To permanently set this directory as the location of the DB, add it to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export DB_LOCATION=/data/ROMI/DB&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc 
</code></pre></div></p>
</div>
<h2 id="serve-the-rest-api">Serve the REST API<a class="headerlink" href="#serve-the-rest-api" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Then you can start the REST API with <code>romi_scanner_rest_api</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>romi_scanner_rest_api
</code></pre></div>
You should see something like:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>n scans = 2
 * Serving Flask app &quot;romi_scanner_rest_api&quot; (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>To access the REST API, open your favorite browser and use URLs to access:</p>
<ul>
<li>the list of all scans: <a href="http://0.0.0.0:5000/scans">http://0.0.0.0:5000/scans</a></li>
<li>the '2018-12-17_17-05-35' dataset: <a href="http://0.0.0.0:5000/scans/2018-12-17_17-05-35">http://0.0.0.0:5000/scans/2018-12-17_17-05-35</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should see JSON formatted text.</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>:
When starting the REST API with <code>romi_scanner_rest_api</code>, if you get an error message about this executable not being found, it may be missing from the <code>$PATH</code> environement variable.
Add it with:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span>:<span class="s2">&quot;/home/</span><span class="nv">$USER</span><span class="s2">/.local/bin&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To permanently set this in your bash terminal, add it to your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/.local/bin&#39;</span> &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc 
</code></pre></div></p>
</div>
                
                  
                
                
              
              
                


              
            </article>
