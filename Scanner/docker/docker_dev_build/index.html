<ol>
<li>base: with the system dependencies and the two slowest ROMI packages to install: <code>romicgal</code> (not under active development) and <code>romiseg</code>. </li>
<li>dev: use the base image to install the remaining ROMI libraries <strong>in editable mode</strong> <code>romidata</code>, <code>romiscan</code> &amp; <code>romiscanner</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then use a convenience bash script to start a container based on the dev image &amp; run ROMI commands. </p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We could install the <code>requirements.txt</code> of <code>romiscan</code> to save more build time!</p>

<p>To do execute a task on a scan dataset located on the host machine, you have to bind it to the container.
Use the <code>-p</code> or <code>--database_path</code> option to provide an <strong>absolute</strong> path to a valid ROMI database, <em>e.g.</em> <code>-p /data/ROMI/DB</code>.
The mounted database should be available in <code>~/db</code>.</p>
<p>To bind extra directories of the host to the container, use the <code>-v</code> or <code>--volume</code> option.
Note that it can be called multiple times. 
For example if you want to provide your own TOML configuration files directory, <em>e.g.</em> in <code>/data/ROMI/configs</code>, add <code>-v /data/ROMI/configs:/data/$USER/configs</code></p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>In the volume binding example before <code>$USER</code> refers to the one use to build the base image.
If you have built it, this should work!</p>
</div>
<p>If you have made some changes to the branch you are working on, add the <code>--update</code> option to update the container before passing your command.</p>
<h4 id="example1-run-the-anglesandinternode-task-with-the-ml-pipeline">Example1: run the <code>AnglesAndInternode</code> task with the ML pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#example1-run-the-anglesandinternode-task-with-the-ml-pipeline" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>In this example we bind a ROMI database to the container an run the test ML pipeline from the <code>romiscan</code> sources on the <code>arabido_test2_ml</code>: 
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./run.sh -t my_branch <span class="se">\</span>
         -p /home/scanner/database_jcharlaix/scans_reconstructed/ <span class="se">\</span>
         -c <span class="s1">&#39;romi_run_task --config romiscan/config/ml_pipe_test.toml \</span>
<span class="s1">                           AnglesAndInternodes db/arabido_test2_ml/&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<h4 id="example2-run-the-anglesandinternode-task-with-the-geometric-pipeline-print-tasks-infos">Example2: run the <code>AnglesAndInternode</code> task with the geometric pipeline &amp; print tasks infos<a class="headerlink" href="#example2-run-the-anglesandinternode-task-with-the-geometric-pipeline-print-tasks-infos" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>To invokes mutliples commands, you can either chain the tasks with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> in the bash command you provides:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./run.sh -t my_branch -p /home/scanner/database_jcharlaix/scans_reconstructed/ -c <span class="s1">&#39;romi_run_task --config romiscan/config/ml_pipe_test.toml AnglesAndInternodes db/arabido_test2_ml/ &amp;&amp; print_task_info PointCloud db/arabido_test2_ml/ &amp;&amp; print_task_info AnglesAndInternodes db/arabido_test2_ml/&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
This wil run the three commands (there could be more) in the same container.</p>
<p>Or makes multiples calls to the <code>run.sh</code> script:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>./run.sh -t my_branch -p /home/scanner/database_jcharlaix/scans_reconstructed/ -c <span class="s1">&#39;romi_run_task --config romiscan/config/ml_pipe_test.toml AnglesAndInternodes db/arabido_test2_ml/&#39;</span>
./run.sh -t my_branch -p /home/scanner/database_jcharlaix/scans_reconstructed/ -c <span class="s1">&#39;print_task_info PointCloud db/arabido_test2_ml/&#39;</span>
./run.sh -t my_branch -p /home/scanner/database_jcharlaix/scans_reconstructed/ -c <span class="s1">&#39;print_task_info AnglesAndInternodes db/arabido_test2_ml/&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
This will creates multiples containers, one for each call, but they should be automatically removed.</p>
