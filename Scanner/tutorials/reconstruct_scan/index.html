<p>If you made a mess, had a failure or just want to start fresh with your dataset, no need to save a copy on the side, you can use the <code>Clean</code> task:

Here the config may use the <code>[Clean]</code> section where you can defines the <code>force</code> option:

<span class="n">force</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">true</span>
