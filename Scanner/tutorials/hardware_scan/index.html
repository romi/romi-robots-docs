<p>To follows this guide you should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>built the scanner <a href="../../build/">here</a></li>
<li>installed the necessary ROMI software <a href="../../install/plant_scanner_setup/">here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To quickly create an example DB you can use:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>wget https://db.romi-project.eu/models/test_db.tar.gz
tar -xf test_db.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>
This will create a <code>integration_tests</code> folder with a ready to use test database. </p>
<h2 id="running-scans">Running scans<a class="headerlink" href="#running-scans" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p><code>Scan</code> is the basic task for running a task with the scanner.</p>

<p>Assuming you have an active database, you can nom run a scan using <code>romi_run_task</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>romi_run_task --config scanner.toml Scan /path/to/db/scan_id/ --local-scheduler
</code></pre></div>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/path/to/db</code> must be an existing FSDB database</li>
<li><code>scan_id</code> must not already exist in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will create the corresponding folder and fill it with images from the scan.</p>
