                <h1 id="how-to-use-the-romi-scanner-software">How to use the ROMI scanner software?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-use-the-romi-scanner-software" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h1>
<p>We here assume you have followed the "installation instructions" available <a href="../../install/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>There are some requirements to use the different algorithms in the pipeline.
Most of them are installed automatically from the requirements file when using pip.
The most important part is <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">Colmap</a> (v3.6).</p>
<p>The two requirements that are not shipped with pip are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://colmap.github.io/">Colmap</a> (v3.6) for the structure from motion algorithms</li>
<li><a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> (&gt;= 2.81) for the virtual scanner</li>
</ul>
<p>Preferably, create a virtual environment for python 3.7 or python 3.8 using <code>virtualenv</code> or a conda environment specific to the 3D Scanner.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If using python 3.8, Open3D binaries are not yet available on pip, therefore you have to build Open3D from sources!</p>
</div>
<h2 id="basic-usage">Basic usage<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-usage" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Every task on the scanner is launched through the <code>romi_run_task</code> command provided in
the <code>romiscan</code> module. It is a wrapper for <code>luigi</code>, with preloaded tasks from
the <code>romiscan</code> module.</p>
<p>The general usage is as follows:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>romi_run_task <span class="o">[</span>-h<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>--config CONFIG<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>--luigicmd LUIGICMD<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>--module MODULE<span class="o">]</span>
<span class="o">[</span>--local-scheduler<span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">[</span>--log-level LOG_LEVEL<span class="o">]</span> task scan
</code></pre></div></p>
<ul>
<li><code>CONFIG</code> is either a file or a folder. If a file, it must be <code>json</code> or <code>toml</code> and contains the configuration of the task to run. If a folder, it will read all configuration files in <code>json</code> or <code>toml</code> format from the folder.</li>
<li><code>LUIGICMD</code> is an optional parameter specifying an alternative command for <code>luigi</code>.</li>
<li><code>MODULE</code> is an optional parameter for running task from external modules (see TODO).</li>
<li><code>LOG_LEVEL</code> is the level of logging. Defaults to <code>INFO</code>, but can be set to <code>DEBUG</code> to increase verbosity.</li>
<li><code>task</code> is the name of the class to run (see TODO)</li>
<li><code>scan</code> is the location of the target <code>scan</code> on which to process the task. It is of the form <code>DB_LOCATION/SCAN_ID</code>, where <code>DB_LOCATION</code> is a path containing the <code>romidb</code> marker.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configuration-files">Configuration files<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-files" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>The configuration is in the form of a dictionary, in which each key is the ID of a given task.
In <code>toml</code> format, it reads as follows:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[FirstTask]</span>
<span class="n">parameter1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value1</span>
<span class="n">parameter2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value2</span>
<span class="k">[SecondTask]</span>
<span class="n">parameter1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value1</span>
<span class="n">parameter2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value2</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<h2 id="pipelines">Pipelines<a class="headerlink" href="#pipelines" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>This is a sample configuration for the <em>full reconstruction pipeline</em>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[Colmap]</span>
<span class="n">matcher</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;exhaustive&quot;</span>

<p>To run the <em>full reconstruction pipeline</em> use this configuration file with <code>romi_run_task</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>romi_run_task --config scanner.json AnglesAndInternodes /path/to/db/scan_id/ --local-scheduler
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>This will process all tasks up to the <code>AnglesAndInternodes</code> task.
Every task produces a <code>Fileset</code>, a subdirectory in the scan directory whose name starts the same as the task name.
The characters following are a hash of the configuration of the task, so that the outputs of the same task with different parameters can coexist in the same scan.
Any change in the parameters will make the needed task to be recomputed with subsequent calls of <code>romi_run_task</code>.
Already computed tasks will be left untouched.</p>
<p>To recompute a task, just delete the corresponding folder in the scan directory and rerun <code>romi_run_task</code>.</p>
