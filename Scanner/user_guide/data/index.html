<p>Let's assume you have a list of images of a given object and that you want to add them to a ROMI database as a "scan".</p>
<h4 id="1-initialize-database">1 - Initialize database<a class="headerlink" href="#1-initialize-database" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>First create the directory for the database and add the <code>romidb</code> marker to it:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">os.path</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">join</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">tempfile</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">mkdtemp</span>
<span class="n">mydb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mkdtemp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prefix</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;romidb_&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">join</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mydb</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;romidb&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="s1">&#39;w&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Now you can initialize a ROMI <code>FSDB</code> database object:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">romidata.fsdb</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FSDB</span>
<span class="n">db</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FSDB</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">mydb</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># Locks the database and allows access</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<h4 id="2-create-a-new-dataset">2 - Create a new dataset<a class="headerlink" href="#2-create-a-new-dataset" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>To create a new dataset, here named <code>myscan_001</code>, do:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">scan</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;myscan_001&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
To add <em>scan metadata</em> (<em>eg.</em> camera settings, biological metadata, hardware metadata...), do:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">scan</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_metadata</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s2">&quot;scanner&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;harware&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;test&#39;</span><span class="p">}})</span>
</code></pre></div>
This will results in several changes in the local database:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add a <code>myscan_001</code> sub-directory in the database root directory;</li>
<li>Add a <code>metadata</code> sub-directory in <code>myscan_001</code> and a <code>metadata.json</code> gathering the given <em>scan metadata</em>.</li>

<p>OPTIONAL - create a list of RGB images
    If you do not have a scan datasets available, either download a shared datasets <a href="https://db.romi-project.eu/models/test_db.tar.gz">here</a> or generate a list of images as follows:

</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new <code>fileset</code>:

</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the images to the fileset:
    Load the file list (or skip if you generated random images):
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">os</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">listdir</span>

</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then loop the images list and add them to the <code>fileset</code>, optionally attach some metadata to each image:
    <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">romidata</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">io</span>

</code></pre></div></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This will results in several changes in the local database:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reference the image by its file name by adding an entry in <code>files.json</code>;</li>
<li>Write a <code>scan_img_1.jpeg</code> image in the <code>images</code> sub-directory of the scan <code>"myscan"</code>.</li>

<h3 id="overview">Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Hereafter we give an overview of the database structure using the ROMI database terminology: 
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>romidb_root/
├── dataset_001/
│   ├── fileset_A/

├── (lock)
└── romidb
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="database-root-directory">Database root directory<a class="headerlink" href="#database-root-directory" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>A <em>root database</em> directory is defined, <em>eg.</em> <code>mydb/</code>.
Inside this directory we need to defines (add) the <code>romidb</code> marker so it may be used by <code>FSDB</code> class.
We may also find the <code>lock</code> file used to limit the access to the database to only one user. </p>
<p>Note that the database initialization part is manual. 
To create them, in a terminal:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mkdir mydb
touch mydb/romidb
</code></pre></div>
We just created the following tree structure:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mydb/
└── romidb
</code></pre></div>
Once you have created this root directory and the <code>romidb</code> marker file, you can initialize a ROMI <code>FSDB</code> database object in Python:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">romidata.fsdb</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">FSDB</span>
<span class="n">db</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FSDB</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;mydb&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
The method <code>FSDB.connect()</code> locks the database with a <code>lock</code> file at root directory and allows access.
To disconnect and <em>free the database</em> do:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">disconnect</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>
If for some reason the Python terminal unexpectedly terminate without a call to the <code>disconnect</code> method, you may have to remove the <code>lock</code> file manually.
Check that no one else is using the database! </p>
<p>Within this <em>root database</em> directory you will find other directories corresponding to <em>datasets</em>.</p>
<h3 id="datasets-directories">Datasets directories<a class="headerlink" href="#datasets-directories" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>At the next level, we find the <em>datasets</em> directory(s), <em>eg.</em> named <code>myscan_001</code>.
Their names must be uniques and you create them as follow:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">scan</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_scan</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;myscan_001&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
If you add <em>scan metadata</em> (<em>eg.</em> camera settings, biological metadata, hardware metadata...) with <code>scan.set_metadata()</code>, you get another directory <code>metadata</code> with a <code>metadata.json</code> file.
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">scan</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_metadata</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s2">&quot;scanner&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;hardware&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;test&#39;</span><span class="p">}})</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>We now have the following tree structure:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mydb/
├── myscan_001/
│   └── metadata/
│       └── metadata.json
└── romidb
</code></pre></div>
And the file <code>metadata.json</code> should look like this:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;scanner&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;harware&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;test&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<h3 id="images-directories">Images directories<a class="headerlink" href="#images-directories" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h3>
<p>Inside <code>myscan_001/</code>, we find the datasets or <em>fileset</em> in <code>romidb</code> terminology.
In the case of the "plant scanner", this is a list of RGB image files acquired by a camera moving around the plant.
To store the datasets, we thus name the created <em>fileset</em> "images":
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">fileset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">scan</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_fileset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;images&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
This create an <code>images</code> directory and a <code>files.json</code> at the dataset root directory.
We now have the following tree structure:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>mydb/
├── myscan_001/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── metadata/
│   │   └── metadata.json
│   └── files.json
└── romidb
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>The JSON should look like this:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;filesets&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;files&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[],</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;images&quot;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>We then create random RGB images to add to the dataset:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>

<span class="c1"># Generate random noise images</span>
<span class="n">n_images</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span>
<span class="n">imgs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n_images</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">256</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">random</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rand</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">256</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">256</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="n">imgs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">img</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>And we add them with their metadata to the database:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">img</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">enumerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">imgs</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="n">file</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fileset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_file</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">io</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write_image</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">img</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_metadata</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;key&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">fname</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_metadata</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;id&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>Inside this <code>images/</code> directory will reside the images added to the database.
At the same time you added images with <strong>REF_TO_TUTO</strong>, you created an entry in a JSON file referencing the files.
If you added metadata along with the files (<em>eg.</em> camera poses, jpeg metadata...) it should be referenced in <code>metadata/images/</code> <em>eg.</em> <code>metadata/images/&lt;scan_img_01&gt;.json</code>.
