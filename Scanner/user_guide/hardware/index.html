<h2 id="hardware-configuration-files">Hardware configuration files<a class="headerlink" href="#hardware-configuration-files" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>To gather configuration information of the hardware we use <code>toml</code> files to define variables.
This allows for easy import in python.</p>
<p>For example, saving the following lines in a <code>config.toml</code>:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">[Scan.scanner]</span>

<span class="n">gimbal_firmware</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;blgimbal&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div></p>
<p>In python:

<h4 id="2-configure-wpa_supplicant-as-access-point">2. Configure <code>wpa_supplicant</code> as access point<a class="headerlink" href="#2-configure-wpa_supplicant-as-access-point" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>To configure <code>wpa_supplicant</code> as access point create this file with your settings for <code>country=</code>, <code>ssid=</code>, <code>psk=</code> and maybe <code>frequency=</code>.
You can just copy and paste this in one block to your command line beginning with cat and including both EOF (delimiter EOF will not get part of the file):
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cat &gt; /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf &lt;&lt;EOF
country=DE
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=&quot;RPiNet&quot;
    mode=2
    frequency=2437
    #key_mgmt=NONE   # uncomment this for an open hotspot
    # delete next 3 lines if key_mgmt=NONE
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    proto=RSN WPA
    psk=&quot;password&quot;
}
EOF
</code></pre></div></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>chmod <span class="m">600</span> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service
systemctl <span class="nb">enable</span> wpa_supplicant@wlan0.service
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="setting-up-a-stand-alone-access-point">Setting up a stand alone access point<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-a-stand-alone-access-point" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h4>
<p>Example for this setup:
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>                 wifi
mobile-phone &lt;~.~.~.~.~&gt; <span class="o">(</span>wlan0<span class="o">)</span>RPi<span class="o">(</span>eth0<span class="o">)</span>
            <span class="se">\ </span>            /
           <span class="o">(</span>dhcp<span class="o">)</span>   <span class="m">192</span>.168.4.1
</code></pre></div>
Do "General setup" then create the following file to configure <code>wlan0</code>.
We only have the access point. There is no ethernet device configured.</p>
<p><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cat &gt; /etc/systemd/network/08-wlan0.network <span class="s">&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span class="s">[Match]</span>
<span class="s">Name=wlan0</span>
<span class="s">[Network]</span>
<span class="s">Address=192.168.4.1/24</span>
<span class="s">MulticastDNS=yes</span>
<span class="s">DHCPServer=yes</span>
<span class="s">EOF</span>
</code></pre></div>
If you want this then reboot.
That's it.
Otherwise go on, no need to reboot at this time.</p>
