<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Each tasks has some default configuration but to create a working pipeline, you need to set some parameters in a TOML configuration file.</p>
<p>There are two types of parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>those associated with luigi: upstream tasks, requirements &amp; outputs</li>
<li>those tuning the used algorithms: variables &amp; parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>For examples look at the configurations <a href="https://github.com/romi/romiscan/tree/dev/config">examples</a> provided in <code>romiscan/configs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="io-tasks">I/O tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#io-tasks" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>These tasks refers to the inputs and outputs of each algorithmic tasks.
They are often related to tasks defined in the <code>romidata</code> library.</p>
