<p>Hardware metadata are informative of the hardware setup like the used camera, its firmwares or the workspace size.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>Here is a list of hardware metadata and their definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>frame</strong>: scanner frame type and version, <em>eg</em>: "30profile v1";</li>
<li><strong>X_motor</strong>: type of motor used for the X axis, <em>eg</em>: "X-Carve NEMA23";</li>
<li><strong>Y_motor</strong>: type of motor used for the Y axis, <em>eg</em>: "X-Carve NEMA23";</li>
<li><strong>Z_motor</strong>: type of motor used for the Z axis, <em>eg</em>: "X-Carve NEMA23";</li>
<li><strong>pan_motor</strong>: , type of motor used for the camera pan axis, <em>eg</em>: "Dynamixel";</li>
<li><strong>tilt_motor</strong>: , type of motor used for the camera tilt axis, <em>eg</em>: "Gimball";</li>
<li><strong>sensor</strong>: type of sensor used during acquisition, <em>eg</em>: "Sony alpha";</li>
<li><strong>scan_os</strong>: , <em>eg</em>: "";</li>
</ul>
<p>The metadata dictionary made of <code>frame</code>, <code>X_motor</code>, <code>Y_motor</code>, <code>Z_motor</code>, <code>pan_motor</code> &amp; <code>tilt_motor</code> define the <strong>hardware_id</strong> used in the <code>README.md</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>sensor</code> metadata could be more detailed, for example as a dictionary or a reference to a <strong>sensor_id</strong> database?</p>
